<p>There were four brothers that found a treasure chest of prizes while they were playing
outside. The noticed that there were four prizes to choose from. So they decided to each pick
a prizes based on their age. The first one to go was the youngest boy Jon, 10. He picked the 
teddy bear. Then the next three brothers grabbed their prize. Bob picked the RC Car, Tom had
the toy car and Rob ended up with the Water Gun. They were all happy with their prizes and
had fun the rest of the day outside. What if Jon was 14? He would of probably went last. </p>
